## üéÆ Code Snippet

Here‚Äôs a glimpse into the inner workings of the app:

```python
import ttkbootstrap as ttk
from ttkbootstrap.constants import *
import serial
import serial.tools.list_ports
import threading
import winsound

class SerialApp:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.root.title("Serial Shenanigans: COMedy Edition")
        self.root.resizable(False, False)
        self.serial_port = None
        self.read_thread = None
        self.stop_thread = threading.Event()

        # Set window icon (optional)
        icon_image = ttk.PhotoImage(file="icon.png")
        root.tk.call("wm", "iconphoto", root._w, icon_image)
