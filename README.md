## üéÆ Code Snippet

Here‚Äôs a glimpse into the inner workings of the app:

```python
import ttkbootstrap as ttk
from ttkbootstrap.constants import *
import serial
import serial.tools.list_ports
import threading
import winsound

class SerialApp:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.root.title("Serial Shenanigans: COMedy Edition")
        self.root.resizable(False, False)
        self.serial_port = None
        self.read_thread = None
        self.stop_thread = threading.Event()

        # Set window icon (optional)
        icon_image = ttk.PhotoImage(file="icon.png")
        root.tk.call("wm", "iconphoto", root._w, icon_image)

        # Frame for Port and Baudrate Configuration
        config_frame = ttk.Labelframe(root, text="Configuration", padding=10)
        config_frame.pack(fill=X, padx=10, pady=10)

        # COM Port Selection
        ttk.Label(config_frame, text="COM Port:").grid(row=0, column=0, padx=5, pady=5, sticky='nsew')
        self.port_var = ttk.StringVar()
        self.port_menu = ttk.Combobox(config_frame, textvariable=self.port_var, state="readonly")
        self.port_menu.grid(row=0, column=1, padx=5, pady=5, sticky='nsew')
        self.refresh_ports()
```
